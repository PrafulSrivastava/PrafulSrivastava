# 👋 Hey, I'm Praful

A systems engineer who builds things at the intersection of **low-level software**, **applied AI**, and **real-world products**. Based in Stuttgart, working at Mercedes-Benz.

I started deep in C++ with performance systems, design patterns, and simulations. Over time I moved into LLM tooling, agentic workflows, and product-driven engineering. The thread connecting all of it: I like understanding how things actually work before deciding how to build them.

## 🧠 What I work on now

**Agentic AI & LLM Systems:** routing, orchestration, multi-agent pipelines, and tools that use LLMs to solve real friction points (not demos).

**Applied Product Engineering:** turning vague problems into working systems. MVPs first, then hardening what matters.

**Systems & Performance:** still very much in the DNA. Event-driven architectures, resource-constrained environments, and the kind of design thinking that only comes from years in C++.

## 🚀 Projects worth looking at

| Project | What it does |
|---|---|
| **[PolicyQ](https://github.com/PrafulSrivastava/PolicyQ)** | Knowledge interface for navigating complex policy documents with precision. No summaries, no opinions, just answers. |
| **[ApiKeyRouter](https://github.com/PrafulSrivastava/ApiKeyRouter)** | Routes LLM requests across providers, optimizing for cost, reliability, and throughput simultaneously. |
| **[Agentic-Dev-Team](https://github.com/PrafulSrivastava/Agentic-Dev-Team)** | A virtual engineering team (Lead → Dev → Tester) built on LLM agents that takes a prompt and ships a working Python app. |
| **[TradeLens-AI](https://github.com/PrafulSrivastava/TradeLens-AI)** | Agentic financial analysis. Turns a natural language query into a 0–100 investment likelihood score. |
| **[CodeReviewAssistant](https://github.com/PrafulSrivastava/CodeReviewAssistant)** | LLM-powered code review focused on *why* a change matters: context, trade-offs, and architectural feedback. |
| **[CruiseCast](https://github.com/PrafulSrivastava/CruiseCast)** | Web-based adaptive cruise control simulation combining clustering algorithms with map visualization. |
| **[LLM_Theatre](https://github.com/PrafulSrivastava/LLM_Theatre)** | Multi-agent storytelling experiment. Dynamic narrative generation through orchestrated LLM interactions. |
| **[QuirkyChangeLogger](https://github.com/PrafulSrivastava/QuirkyChangeLogger)** | Turns boring changelogs into wildly over-dramatized narratives. Because why not. |

*Older repos cover game engines, C++ simulations, evolutionary algorithms, and design pattern explorations. The foundations everything else is built on.*

## 📐 How I think about engineering

- Performance matters, but only where it actually matters.
- Most "technical" problems are product problems in disguise.
- AI systems should be auditable, debuggable, and boring in production.
- Abstractions are useful until they leak. Then you need to understand what's underneath.

## 🦆 A bit more about me

Dedicated duck. C++ enthusiast turned AI systems builder. Loves writing and gaming, which is probably why half my projects have personality built in.

Currently exploring AI-native product ideas, particularly tools that help people navigate complex information without getting lost in it.
